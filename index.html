        <p>In this study, researchers used an interview style process to determine how much and what kind of information children can remember from educational films. These interviews consisted of six parts: a free recall, open-ended questions, recognition questions, important information questions, unimportant information questions, and personal experience questions. In order to compare, the control group of students was taught a school lesson, another group watched a film only once, another group watched the film twice, and the final group of students was taught a school lesson and watched the film. The following is the data results of these interviews showing the average percentage of correct answers on each type of question.</p>
